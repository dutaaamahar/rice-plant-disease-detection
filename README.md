# Rice Plant Disease Detection

## Project Overview

The project, "Identifikasi Penyakit pada Tanaman Padi menggunakan Metode Convolutional Neural Network," is a web application developed as a requirement for completing a Bachelor's degree in Informatics Engineering. This web app is capable of identifying four types of diseases in rice plants: Bacterial Blight, Blast, Brown Spot, and Tungro. Users can upload images of rice plant diseases they wish to identify in .jpg, .jpeg, or .png formats, with a maximum file size of 200MB.

## Project Structure

- `rice-plant-disease-detection/` : This directory is designated for handling the Web App components within the Streamlit project named `ai-digital-sales-tracking`.

- `STREAMLIT-APP/` : This is the main directory for our Streamlit Web App dedicated to Rice Plant Disease Detection. It likely contains the core components and configurations for the entire feature.

- `STREAMLIT-APP/models/` : This directory is dedicated to housing machine learning models that are an integral part of the Rice Plant Disease Detection Web App. It is the designated location for storing and managing the trained models.
